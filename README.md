#Real-Time Random OTP Generator

To generate the OTP in random manner
This is a Python-based project that generates random OTPs (One-Time Passwords) in real-time. OTPs are commonly used for various authentication purposes, such as two-factor authentication (2FA) or password reset processes.

Here I'm using Google collab or else you can use Jupyter Notebook
